    <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 16<br>
    <strong>University:</strong> Dong-A University</p>

    <p>On May 16th, we had a field trip to Pohang organized by "Sky Will Agency." We started from Dong-A University at around 10:15 AM and arrived at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) by 12:30 PM. After a long 2-hour bus ride, we took about an hour to relax, breathe in some fresh air, and enjoy the surroundings. Around the lake at POSTECH, we had some snacks and a Subway sandwich lunch provided by the organizers. The location was peaceful, and our tour guides were very kind‚Äîalways ready to explain even the smallest details for us.</p>

    <h2>üìç Robo-Life Museum ‚Äì POSCO</h2>
    <p>At 1:30 PM, we arrived at our next destination: the Robo-Life Museum inside the POSCO complex. The entrance had a unique robot statue posed like it was thinking‚Äîvery futuristic! Inside, we saw mini-bots, androids, drones, and even a robot dance performance. One of the most memorable parts was seeing AI pets like robotic dogs and cats. There was even a toy-serving robot, although the toys were a bit pricey.</p>
    <p>We tried several robots ourselves. The Virtual Aquarium let us color a fish on paper, scan it, and watch it appear in a digital tank. We also saw football-playing robots, a virtual drone controller, and of course, Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, who transformed between robot and humanoid forms. It was exciting and definitely one of the highlights of the trip.</p>

    <h2>üìç Saemaul Memorial Hall</h2>
    <p>At around 3:30 PM, we visited the Saemaul Memorial Hall, which focuses on the Saemaul Movement and its impact on South Korea‚Äôs rural development. The museum was simple and easy to understand‚Äînot too philosophical. It also started to rain a little, which made the moment more peaceful and memorable.</p>

    <h2>üìç Pohang Spacewalk</h2>
    <p>Finally, we went to the Pohang Spacewalk, a unique landmark in the city. Even in the rain, we were allowed to walk on the structure, which turned out to be an amazing experience. One downside was that we had to walk more than 1 km to reach the structure because the bus wasn‚Äôt allowed nearby, which was tiring after a long day.</p>
    <p>After that, we had another 2-hour bus ride back to Dong-A University.</p>

    <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Despite a few small inconveniences‚Äîlike the long travel time and extra walking‚Äîthe field trip was really worthwhile. The Robo-Life Museum left the strongest impression on me because it was hands-on, fun, and futuristic. I would rate the trip a solid 4 out of 5.</p>

    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
    <p>For the next field trip in the second semester, I would love to visit Jeonju Hanok Village. After exploring cutting-edge technology in Pohang, it would be refreshing to experience Korea‚Äôs traditional culture. Jeonju is known for its hanbok rentals, old houses, and traditional food like bibimbap. I believe it would offer a perfect cultural contrast to this trip.</p>
