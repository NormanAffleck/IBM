    <h2>Southwest Airlines’ Fee Strategy Shift</h2>

    <p>In a notable departure from its customer-friendly model, Southwest Airlines has decided to implement checked baggage fees starting May 28, 2025. The first checked bag will cost $35, and the second $45—unless passengers hold the airline’s credit card or elite status, in which case they can still enjoy one or two free bags depending on their loyalty tier.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>This change signifies a major strategic shift for the Dallas-based airline, which had long used its “Bags Fly Free” slogan as a competitive differentiator. The decision mirrors industry trends, where most rivals already charge for checked luggage. This pivot allows Southwest to generate additional revenue, likely in response to increasing operational costs or pressure to remain financially competitive.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Beyond baggage fees, the airline is phasing out other hallmarks of its model. Open seating—a trademark feature—is also being replaced with assigned seating, further aligning the company with standard industry practices. Although these moves may alienate loyal customers, they represent calculated strategic decisions aimed at long-term profitability and market adaptation.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>From a marketing perspective, this case highlights the tension between brand identity and revenue management. Southwest's challenge will be maintaining its reputation for customer satisfaction while adopting policies it long resisted.</p>
