    <h2>Introduction to Marketing</h2>
    <p>Marketing is defined as the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.</p>

    <h2>Marketing 4.0 Era</h2>
    <p>Marketing 4.0 represents a transition from traditional to digital marketing, combining online and offline engagement. It emphasizes authenticity, flexibility, and adaptation to rapid technological changes.</p>

    <h2>Marketing Process</h2>
    <p>The five-step marketing process includes understanding customer needs, designing a customer-driven strategy, preparing an integrated marketing program, building customer relationships, and capturing value from customers.</p>

    <h2>Customer Needs, Wants, and Demands</h2>
    <p>Needs are states of deprivation. Wants are needs shaped by culture and personality. Demands are wants backed by purchasing power.</p>

    <h2>Customer Value and Satisfaction</h2>
    <p>Customer value is the perceived benefit versus cost. Marketers must manage expectations—setting them too high risks dissatisfaction, while too low may fail to attract.</p>

    <h2>Exchanges and Markets</h2>
    <p>Marketing involves exchange: obtaining a desired object by offering something in return. Markets are actual and potential buyers of a product.</p>

    <h2>Designing a Customer-Driven Strategy</h2>
    <p>Target markets are selected through segmentation (e.g., by age, gender, income). A strong value proposition differentiates the company from competitors.</p>

    <h2>Marketing Management Orientations</h2>
    <p>There are five orientations: Production, Product, Selling, Marketing, and Societal. Each has a distinct focus—from efficiency to long-term societal good.</p>
