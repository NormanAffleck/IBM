            <p>Exactly! Rating: 9/10. Follow-up question: How do you think the system handles file synchronization? What happens when you make changes to a file on one device?</p>

            <p>Google Drive's synchronization process ensures files are consistently updated across devices. When a file is changed on one device, the entire file, not just the changes, is uploaded or downloaded to maintain consistency, according to a Super User thread. This process maintains a consistent copy of the file across all connected devices, allowing for easy access and editing from anywhere. </p>

            <p>Yeah, it maybe a little discomfort. All activities will be stored once They are happened. You need to wait until the connection to your internet gets restored. However, as soon as it gets back, the changes happen. Additionally Google Drive doesn't merge offline changes, but rather uses the most recent version available when the connection is restored.</p>

            <p>Exactly! Rating: 9/10. Follow-up question: Can you think of any situations where file conflicts might happen in Google Drive, and how would you expect Drive to handle them?</p>

        <div class="chat-entry">
            <p class="Cadet 10" style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>Cadet 10:</strong></p>
            <p>In Google Drive, file conflicts can happen when multiple users simultaneously edit and save a file, leading to different versions of the same document existing in the cloud. Drive handles these conflicts by choosing the last saved version, often creating a "conflict copy" with the file name modified to include [Conflict]. It also keeps track of past versions for a limited time, allowing users to back to earlier states.</p>

            <p>To avoid file conflicts in Google Drive during collaboration, suing shared drives, make clear permissions and roles, and limit Google Drive's built-in features like version history and comments. let's move to some other theme, Google docs, spreadsheets, collab, ppt and etc.</p>

            <p>One of the distinct advantages of using Google Docs is its compatibility with other applications such as Microsoft Word, making it easy for users to transfer existing documents into Google Docs format quickly and easily. Also Microsoft Word and Excel didn't have android versions.</p>

            <p>Google Docs uses Operational Transformation and a robust "client-server" architecture to enable real-time collaboration. It handles simultaneous edits from multiple users by breaking down changes into "operations" and synchronizing them across all connected clients, resolving conflicts gracefully.</p>

            <p>If a user loses their internet connection while editing a Google Docs, they can continue working offline, and changes will be automatically saved to their device. When the internet connection is restored, Google Docs will automatically sync the offline changes with the cloud, overwriting previous versions if necessary.</p>

            <p>It's crusial when you are working with something that needs constant edits. Being able to access, review, and even revert changes that have been made to a document can be crucial to efficiency and productivity. Google Docs Version History allows users to catch up on changes and make sure they know what's different about the latest edition of their document. <h></h> Let's it wrap up with what we have discussed so far.</p>
