    <h2>First Stop: The Temple</h2>
    <p>We began our hike with a peaceful moment at a mountainside temple. The fresh morning air and the scent of incense created a spiritual atmosphere. Intricate sculptures, traditional architecture, and the calm surroundings helped us feel centered before the climb. It was a quiet but powerful start to our journey.</p>

    <h2>The Mokseok Horticultural Hall</h2>
    <p>Roughly 200 meters into our hike, we encountered the Mokseok Horticultural Hall — a stunning garden filled with vibrant flowers and beautifully trimmed shrubs. The colors were rich, and the air was filled with the aroma of blooming plants. This hall served as a peaceful rest point and offered a great photo opportunity.</p>
    <p>It reminded us how close nature and human creativity can coexist. Everyone took a short break here to hydrate and enjoy the beauty around us.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Green Concrete Wall</h2>
    <p>Further along the path, we came across a long concrete wall completely overgrown with grass and vines. It had a magical feel — like a secret passageway from a fantasy movie. The wall was covered with small notes, drawings, and names of past hikers who wanted to leave their mark.</p>
    <p>We proudly added our own message: <em>"Uzbeki"</em> — a symbol of where we come from and our connection to each other. It was a unifying and joyful moment.</p>

    <h2>Reaching the Summit</h2>
    <p>After nearly two and a half hours of climbing, we finally reached the summit of Gudeoksan at 1:00 PM. The view from the top was absolutely breathtaking — a panoramic vista of Busan's hills, valleys, and distant ocean horizons. The breeze was cool, the sky was clear, and all the effort instantly felt worth it.</p>
    <p>We took a moment to reflect, laugh, and celebrate this shared achievement. This wasn't just a physical victory — it was a mental reset and a memory we’ll carry with us.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This hike to Gudeoksan was more than just an outdoor activity. It was a day filled with exploration, reflection, teamwork, and joy. From the temple to the summit, every step was a lesson in patience, connection, and the power of nature.</p>
    <p>We not only pushed our physical limits but also deepened our friendship and appreciation for the natural beauty around us. Truly, a day to remember.</p>
