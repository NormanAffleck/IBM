    <h2>Company and Marketing Strategy</h2>
    <p>This chapter explores how firms develop customer-focused strategies that drive value and growth. Strategic planning aligns a companyâ€™s mission with its environment, goals, and capabilities. A well-crafted strategy helps companies respond to competition and market opportunities with precision and agility.</p>

    <h2>Partnering to Build Customer Relationships</h2>
    <p>Internal partnerships between departments and external partnerships with suppliers, distributors, and customers ensure a consistent value chain. Each partner must work collaboratively to deliver satisfaction at every touchpoint of the marketing journey.</p>

    <h2>Marketing Strategy and the Marketing Mix</h2>
    <p>Targeting and segmentation allow firms to define who to serve, while positioning and differentiation determine how they serve them. The marketing mix (Product, Price, Place, Promotion) is used to design actionable tactics around this strategy.</p>

    <h2>Managing the Marketing Effort</h2>
    <p>Implementation, analysis, and control are essential parts of the marketing process. Companies must track performance metrics and adjust plans according to customer feedback, ROI outcomes, and competitor actions.</p>

    <h2>Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI)</h2>
    <p>ROMI evaluates the financial return from marketing expenses. Effective companies quantify value creation, not just through sales, but through long-term brand equity, loyalty, and advocacy.</p>

    <h2>Strategic Insight</h2>
    <p>Marketing must now embrace agility, innovation, and responsiveness. Beyond textbook strategies, firms are integrating sustainability, ethics, and real-time personalization to remain competitive in today's evolving environment. Success lies in combining classic planning with adaptive execution across digital and global markets.</p>
